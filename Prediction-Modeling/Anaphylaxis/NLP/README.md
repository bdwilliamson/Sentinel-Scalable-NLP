Configurations and data associated with extracting AFEP-identified, anaphylaxis-related UMLS concepts from clinical text. This step will extract the features to be used by the statistical model.

## Prerequisites

* Install Metamap
  * Download UMLS NLM subset
* Install Python 3.10+
  * Install `mml_utils` package

## Usage

1. Create shell scripts to run Metamap on clincial text
   * `mml-build-mmscript-multi run_mm_on_corpus.toml`
   * See instructions in config (`.toml`) file
   * This will output `.sh` scripts for step #2
2. Run Metamap scripts generated by step #1
3. Extract UMLS concepts from clinical text
   * `mml-extract-mml extract_mml.conf`
4. The exported file will contain only those CUIs identified by the AFEP process (and shown in `cuis.txt`)
